NAME
    App::MPDSync - Synchronize MPD with another instance

SYNOPSIS
      mpd-sync --from otherhost --to localhost

DESCRIPTION
    "App::MPDSync" will keep an instance of "MPD" synced with another
    instance. This can be useful for having failover for an online radio
    station.

REQUIREMENTS
    Both MPD instances have to have the exact same files in their libraries
    or the destination server will get out of sync since it will not be able
    to play some of the files from the source server.

    Specifying the same server for both the source and the destination will
    simply stop "MPD" and clear the playlist.

    If another program modifies the playlist of the destination server,
    "mpd-sync" will not try to fix this until it is restarted. As such, the
    servers will then be out of sync.
